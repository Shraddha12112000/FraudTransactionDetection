## Project Description

Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is like looking for needles in a haystack. It requires finding, out of millions of daily transactions, which ones are fraudulent. Due to the ever-increasing amount of data, it is now almost impossible for a human specialist to detect meaningful patterns from transaction data. For this reason, the use of machine learning techniques is now widespread in the field of fraud detection, where information extraction from large datasets is required.
