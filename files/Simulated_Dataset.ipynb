    "This section presents a transaction data simulator of legitimate and fraudulent transactions. This simulator will be used throughout the rest of this book to motivate and assess the efficiency of different fraud detection techniques in a reproducible way.\n",

    "A simulation is necessarily an approximation of reality. Compared to the complexity of the dynamics underlying real-world payment card transaction data, the data simulator that we present below follows a simple design.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple design is a choice. First, having simple rules to generate transactions and fraudulent behaviors will help in interpreting the kind of patterns that different fraud detection techniques can identify. Second, while simple in its design, the data simulator will generate datasets that are challenging to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated datasets will highlight most of the issues that practitioners of fraud detection face using real-world data. In particular, they will include class imbalance (less than 1% of fraudulent transactions), a mix of numerical and categorical features (with categorical features involving a very large number of values), non-trivial relationships between features, and time-dependent fraud scenarios."

    "    The transaction ID: A unique identifier for the transaction\n",
    "    The date and time: Date and time at which the transaction occurs\n",

    "    The terminal ID: The identifier for the merchant (or more precisely the terminal). Each terminal has a unique identifier\n",
    "    The transaction amount: The amount of the transaction.\n",
    "    The fraud label: A binary variable, with the value \n",

    "for a legitimate transaction, or the value\n",
    "\n",
    "    for a fraudulent transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features will be referred to as TRANSACTION_ID, TX_DATETIME, CUSTOMER_ID, TERMINAL_ID, TX_AMOUNT, and TX_FRAUD.\n",

    "The goal of the transaction data simulator will be to generate a table of transactions with these features. This table will be referred to as the labeled transactions table. Such a table is illustrated in Fig. 1."

    "\n",
    "    Generation of customer profiles: Every customer is different in their spending habits. This will be simulated by defining some properties for each customer. The main properties will be their geographical location, their spending frequency, and their spending amounts. The customer properties will be represented as a table, referred to as the customer profile table.\n",
    "    Generation of terminal profiles: Terminal properties will simply consist of a geographical location. The terminal properties will be represented as a table, referred to as the terminal profile table.\n",
    "    Association of customer profiles to terminals: We will assume that customers only make transactions on terminals that are within a radius of \n",
    "\n",
    "    of their geographical locations. This makes the simple assumption that a customer only makes transactions on terminals that are geographically close to their location. This step will consist of adding a feature 'list_terminals' to each customer profile, that contains the set of terminals that a customer can use.\n",
    "    Generation of transactions: The simulator will loop over the set of customer profiles, and generate transactions according to their properties (spending frequencies and amounts, and available terminals). This will result in a table of transactions.\n",
    "    Generation of fraud scenarios: This last step will label the transactions as legitimate or genuine. This will be done by following three different fraud scenarios.\n",

The customer continues to make transactions, and transactions of higher values are made by the fraudster who tries to maximize their gains. Detecting this scenario will require adding features that keep track of the spending habits of the customer. As for scenario 2, since the card is only temporarily compromised, additional strategies that involve concept drift should also be designed.\n",
